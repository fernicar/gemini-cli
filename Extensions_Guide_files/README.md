# Code Examples for Gemini CLI Extensions Guide

This directory contains conceptual code examples that accompany the "Advanced Customization: Beyond Standard Extensions" section of the main `Extensions_Guide.md` document. These examples illustrate how one might approach implementing a feature like an "API Call Preview" for debugging purposes, which requires modification of the CLI's core logic.

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**

*   **Illustrative and Conceptual:** The code provided in this directory is **purely illustrative and conceptual**. It is based on plausible assumptions about the Gemini CLI's internal architecture (e.g., class names like `GeminiClient`, `Config`, method signatures, and file paths like `packages/core/src/...`). These assumptions are derived from reading project documentation (like TINS Readmes) and common software design patterns.
*   **Not Production Code:** This code is **not production-ready** and **cannot be directly run or integrated** into the actual Gemini CLI codebase without significant adaptation to its real structure.
*   **No Access to Source:** These examples were generated without access to the Gemini CLI's actual source code.
*   **Purpose:** The primary purpose of these files is to provide a concrete, albeit hypothetical, demonstration of the *thought process and general steps* involved in:
    *   Attempting provisional local debugging techniques (like monkeypatching, with heavy caveats).
    *   Writing Test-Driven Development (TDD) style tests for a new feature.
    *   Implementing configuration changes and core logic modifications for such a feature.

## File Phasing

The filenames are prefixed to indicate the conceptual phase of development they represent:

*   **`phase_0_monkeypatch_example.ts`**:
    *   Demonstrates the *idea* of monkeypatching a core CLI method for temporary, local debugging.
    *   **Emphasis:** This approach is highly risky, unstable, and heavily dependent on the target application's internals. It is presented with strong disclaimers and is generally not recommended as a robust solution.

*   **`phase_1_api_preview_tests.test.ts`**:
    *   Provides illustrative TDD-style tests (e.g., using a Jest/Vitest-like syntax) for the "API Call Preview" feature.
    *   These tests outline the expected behavior *before* the feature is fully implemented, guiding its development.

*   **`phase_2_config_modifications.ts`**:
    *   Shows conceptual changes that would be needed in the CLI's configuration system (e.g., in a file like `packages/core/src/config/config.ts`) to support the new feature. This includes adding new configuration parameters and accessors.

*   **`phase_2_core_logic_modifications.ts`**:
    *   Illustrates how a core CLI class (e.g., `GeminiClient` in `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`) might be modified to implement the actual logic for the "API Call Preview" feature, including checking the new configuration flags and altering behavior accordingly.

## How to Use These Examples

1.  **Read the Main Guide:** Understand the context provided in the `Extensions_Guide.md`, particularly the "Advanced Customization: Beyond Standard Extensions" section.
2.  **Review the Code Conceptually:** Examine these files to understand the *type* of changes and the *logic* that would be involved, rather than expecting them to be directly executable.
3.  **Adapt to Actual Codebase:** If you were to implement a similar feature in the actual Gemini CLI (or any other application), you would need to:
    *   Thoroughly study the target application's source code.
    *   Adapt the concepts presented here to the specific classes, methods, module structures, and build systems in use.
    *   Write robust error handling, comprehensive tests, and follow the project's contribution guidelines.

These examples are tools for learning and illustration, bridging the gap between abstract guidance and tangible (though hypothetical) code.
